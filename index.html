        <p id="fact">The fashion industry is responsible for 10% of global CO2 emissions each year</p>


         <h2> WHAT WE ARE ABOUT </h2>
   
<p>There are many problems to solve in the fashion industry. The main one is clothing. Fast fashion specifically makes up 10% of global C02 emissions each year when transporting clothes. It also uses a lot of water and energy. The toxic chemicals like dye, pollute water. THe clothes are made from non-renewable sources like Polyester, Acrylic, Nylon, Spandex and Acetate. And the factory or garment workers are mostly women and a lot of them are underage. THey barely get paid any money and the owners don't care about how unsafe their factories are. Fashion brands make their factories in 3rd-world countries because it is cheaper to pay the workers there and they produce more clothes faster. People in 3rd-world countries have to take any job in order to feed their family so the brand owners know that they will take those jobs even if it is abusing them or exploting them. We want to make sure that we can help laboral conditions within the fashion industry, help make more sustainable clothing choices, and make sure clothes are sustainable in all fashion brands. No one should have to be abused in their work. And the environment shouldn't be ruined because of Fashion or clothing. <problem class=""></problem>   </p>
